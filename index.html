        <h2>Why I take Photos</h2>
            <p> My mother used to tell my the best camera is the one you have with you. Ever since I was little I would alwyas carry some type of camera around: whether it was a disposable drug-store model or a digital camcorder I was addicted. There is something truly magical about being able to capture a moment in time. And in many instances, sometimes the distorted reality we create might even be better than real-life.</p>

        <h2> What Camera I Use? </h2>
            <p> Currently, I'm a huge fan of the camera on my iPhone. Apple has streamlined the process of photo creation such that in a split second I can get a decent looking picture. Of course, I also love the ability to edit my photos in VSCO cam and Instagram directly on my camera. Plus, it's rare to see me not glued to my phone anyways. </p>
